Model order reduction approach generates lower dimensional approximations to the original system while preserving model's essential information and computational accuracy. For nonlinear structural dynamic problems, where the stiffness matrix is configuration dependent, an iterative solution procedure is inevitable and a revisit to all the elements is essential for updating the stiffness matrix. In this paper, the nonlinear dynamics of the planar curved beams and 3D cylindrical shells are studied based on the isogeometric analysis and their model order reductions are investigated based on the proper orthogonal decomposition and discrete empirical interpolation method (POD-DEIM). Numerical results show that IGA-based POD-DEIM method significantly improves the computational efficiency of the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the beam and shell structures.
